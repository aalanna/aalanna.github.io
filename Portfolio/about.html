            <p class="text"> Take time to look to at this photo. Just Pure happiness. </p>
            <p class="text">I want to mainly focus of Naruto story. On what he been through, sacrifice he made, and his ambition he thrives for. Naruto was only the child, and he grew up with no family, and the villagers hated him thinking that he himself was the demon fox. Despite Naruto hardship, he continues to help others and protect what he loves the most. I want to support my friends, care for my people, and love all indiviuals. I want to believe after all the hard work, I would get somewhere in life.  </p></div>

            <p> This is from a special anime movie!!! This explains <b>what is a voice, what can our voices do, instead of just talk, our "voices" can reach into our souls to understand each other.</b><p>
