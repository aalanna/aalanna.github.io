            <p>Boo is SOO cute. I kinda believe that she expresses my personality because she always is curious and venture out to different places.</p>

        <div id="Naruto"> 
            <p class="text"> Take time to look to at this photo. Just Pure happiness. </p>
            <p class="text">I want to mainly focus on the Naruto story. Naruto is a show based on a child who develops leadership and confidence over the course of his life. He has made many sacrifices and is very ambitious. Naruto was an only child, and he grew up with no family. The villagers hated him thinking that he was a demon fox. Despite Naruto's hardships, he continued to help others and protect what he loved the most. I identify with this character because I want to support my friends, care for my people, and love all indiviuals. I hope that because of all the hard work I put in, I will get somewhere in life.  </p></div>

        </div>
        <div id="ponyo-txt">
        <p>SOO CUTE! IT'S PONYOOOOOOOOO. You can probaby guess that I LOVE kawaii things. I find ponyo the fish similar to me because I feel that I am swiming in my own little world too! </p>
        </div>
        <div id="voice">
            <img src="A.silent.voice.jpg" height=500px>
            <p> This is from a special anime movie!!! The character is deaf and only understands sign lanuage. This photo shows her trying to be the same as everyone else even though she cannot express herself in the same way. This explains <b>what a voice is, what can our voices do and instead of just talk, our "voices" can reach into our souls to understand each other.</b><p>
            <p><sub>Friendship is something that defies logic and words, it cannot be expressed with words alone.</sub></p></div>
